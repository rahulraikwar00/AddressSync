# Aadhaar Information Syncing System

Welcome to our Address Information Syncing System, a microservice designed to simplify the process of updating personal information across multiple documents. This system utilizes the Aadhaar number as the primary document, allowing users to request updates that will be synchronized with other linked documents of their choosing.

## Key Features

1. [x] **User Registration**: Agencies can seamlessly register for the service by providing essential details such as agency name, email, password, and confirmation.

2. [x] **Update Requests**: Users have the ability to submit requests to update their address information. These requests are then sent to selected agencies for approval or rejection.

3. [x] **Agency Responses**: Agencies can conveniently view and respond to update requests, either approving or rejecting them along with a valid reason for rejection.

4. [x] **Data Retrieval**: The system offers functionality for both users and agencies to retrieve information on registered agencies and update requests.

5. [ ] **SMS Notifications**: Stay informed with SMS notifications that keep users and agencies in the loop regarding the status of their update requests.

6. [ ] **Secure Authentication**: Our system prioritizes security by implementing OAuth2 and JWT for robust authentication and authorization.

7. [x] **Internal Request Status Representation**: Utilizes an internal representation of request status, with `active` indicating a pending status, `reject` for rejection, and `accept` for approval.

8. **FastAPI and Twilio Integration**: Leveraging the power of FastAPI for seamless API development and Twilio for efficient messaging services.

Feel free to explore the functionalities and experience the efficiency of our Aadhaar Information Syncing System.
